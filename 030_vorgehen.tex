	August Smart Lock nach \cite{Ye2017}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item August smart lock (earlier Version) has hard-coded secret key in the application source code \cite{Rose2016}
		\item August: does not perform the 2-factor authentication properly, and the hackers compromising the user email and text message could illegally control the lock
		\item does not perform the password reset process properly, and the	attackers can easily figure out the true verification code for resetting any passwords
		\item Physically-present Attack: Physically performing the attack for the user	who forgets to lock the smart lock
		\item Revoking Attack: Performing the attack from the user who had the legal accessing before, such as the Airbnb tenant, or the household worker
		\item Stealing Attack: Performing the attack as the thief, and stealing the user device to control the smart lock
		\item Relaying Attack: Performing the attack by two attackers to relay the data for interfering with the smart lock control
		\item Bluetooth Jammer \textrightarrow DOS
		\item Mobile Device: Offizielle App fälschen oder bösartige App verwenden \textrightarrow Informationen des Nutzers stehlen \textrightarrow 
		
	\end{itemize}

	Andere
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Kwikset Kevo smart lock but the physical lock contains serious vulnerabilities making it easily compromised, which only takes 10 seconds\cite{Ye2017}
		\item QuickLock Smart Lock does not encrypt the passwords and sends the password to the user who forgets the password in plaintext\cite{Ye2017}
		\item iBluLock Smart Lock 6-character password, which is vulnerable against the brute forcing attack\cite{Ye2017}

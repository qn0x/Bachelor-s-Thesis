  abstract  = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an emerging low-power wireless technology developed for short-range control and monitoring applications that is expected to be incorporated into billions of devices in the next few years. This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 µs, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.},

In the fast-paced lifestyle, it is very difficult to maintain multiple keys for traditional mechanical locks. Electromagnetic smart locks are a possible solution to this problem. To connect a smart lock with a key, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol can be used. BLE protocol is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Ensuring security over BLE is an ongoing challenge. This paper aims to analyze the MITM vulnerability of BLE and develop a possible solution for designing smart-locks with an increased level of security. The observation shows that the combination of Image Steganography and Cryptography helps to overcome the vulnerabilities of BLE protocol.},
